## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [documentation](https://go-wiki.ifrc.org/en/home).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [issues](https://github.com/IFRCGo/go-web-app/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

* Open a [discussion](https://github.com/IFRCGo/go-web-app/discussions).
* Open an [issue](https://github.com/IFRCGo/go-web-app/issues/new/choose).
* Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

## I Want To Contribute

Any individual is welcome to contribute to IFRC GO. The repository currently has two kinds of contribution personas:

* A **Contributor** is any individual who creates an issue/PR, comments on an issue/PR, or contributes in some other way.
