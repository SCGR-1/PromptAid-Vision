The FS accumulation in different containments (e.g. pits, septic tanks) can vary widely depending e.g. containment type, soil conditions, local cleansing practices. In the design of the FSM ERU, a FS accumulation of 1 L FS per person and day has been assumed. Therefore, the FSM ERU is designed to serve 20 000 people and to interface with an MSM20 ERU.",
