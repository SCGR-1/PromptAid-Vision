This is a public health intervention to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to cholera. This includes provision of oral rehydration solution at the ORP and given for home use as well as distribution of Zinc to eligible patient as defined in WHO guidelines. Referral of severely dehydrated and sick patients. WASH activities at the ORP for patients, including hygiene promotion, household water treatment, distribution of hygiene and water items in alignment with activities outside the ORP. Social mobilisation and community engagement and accountability (CEA). Data collection, analysis, interpretation and taking action (at ORP level). Safe management of dead bodies if someone dies at the ORP. One ORP kit can produce enough water each day to treat approximately 35 patients per day using the safe water from the filter. In order to calculate how many ORP kits will be needed, it is important to know the population size and how many people will get sick in the community (attack rate).",
